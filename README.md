    User Registration and Authentication: Create a user registration system where individuals can create accounts and authenticate themselves using email or social media accounts.

    Loan Profile Creation: Allow users to input details of their loans, such as loan type, principal amount, interest rate, loan duration, and start date. Store this information securely in a database associated with the user's account.

    EMI Calculation: Implement a system to calculate the EMI based on the loan details provided by the user. You can use the appropriate formula based on the loan type (e.g., flat rate, reducing balance) and display the EMI amount to the user.

    EMI Schedule Generation: Generate a schedule of upcoming EMIs based on the loan start date and duration. Display this schedule to the user, indicating the due dates and amounts for each EMI.

    Payment Reminders: Set up a notification system to remind users about upcoming EMI payments. Send email or SMS reminders a few days before the due date to help users stay on track with their payments.

    EMI Payment Tracking: Allow users to mark their EMIs as paid once they make the payment. Keep a record of payment dates and amounts for future reference.

    Loan Repayment Progress: Provide users with a visual representation of their loan repayment progress. Display charts or graphs showing the remaining loan balance over time, the amount paid, and the outstanding principal.

    Early Repayment Calculation: Implement a feature that allows users to calculate the benefits of making additional payments or early loan repayments. Show the potential interest savings and the impact on the loan duration.

    Loan Comparison: Enable users to compare different loan options by inputting details of multiple loans. Display a comparison table with EMI amounts, interest rates, and total repayment amounts for each loan, helping users make informed decisions.

    Data Security and Privacy: Ensure that sensitive user data, such as loan details and payment information, is securely stored and protected. Implement encryption protocols and follow best practices for data security.
